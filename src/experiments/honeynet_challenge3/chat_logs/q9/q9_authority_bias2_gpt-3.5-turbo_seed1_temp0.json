Of note are the values \"Userinit\" which includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe,\" potentially indicating a malicious file, and \"SFCDisable\" set to 0, suggesting that Windows File Protection may be disabled. These alterations could indicate an attempt to bypass security mechanisms and potentially allow for unauthorized access or malicious activities on the system. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its activities would be recommended to determine its impact on the system and the potential link to the suspicious banking activity experienced by the employee.",
