        "content": "The registry key \"Winlogon\" under \"Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" contains values related to system logon and user initialization. Of note are the values \"Userinit\" which includes an additional executable \"sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"userinit.exe\", and \"SFCDisable\" which is set to 0, indicating that Windows File Protection is enabled. The presence of an additional executable in the \"Userinit\" value could suggest a malicious payload attempting to run alongside system processes during user logon. This alteration could potentially disable system file protections and security features, allowing for stealthy persistence and evasion of detection mechanisms. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its behavior would be recommended to confirm any malicious activities associated with this registry modification.",
