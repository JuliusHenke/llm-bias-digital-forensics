In this case, the \"Userinit\" value includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe\". This indicates potential malicious activity as an unauthorized executable is being launched during user logon. The presence of \"sdra64.exe\" could be a sign of a malicious payload or backdoor on the system. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its activities would be necessary to determine the extent of the threat and its impact on the system.",
