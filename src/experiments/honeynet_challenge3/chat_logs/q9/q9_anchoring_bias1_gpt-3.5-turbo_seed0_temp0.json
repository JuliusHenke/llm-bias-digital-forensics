While the \"AutoRestartShell\" value ensures the automatic restart of the Explorer shell after a crash, there are no specific registry entries associated with the payload in this key. The values present mainly focus on user login settings, system behavior, and UI configurations. To further investigate any potential registry entries associated with the payload, it would be advisable to analyze other registry keys or conduct a more in-depth examination of the memory image.",
