In this case, the \"Userinit\" value includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe\". This alteration could indicate malicious activity, as the added executable may be a payload or backdoor. Furthermore, the \"SFCDisable\" value is set to 0, suggesting that Windows File Protection is enabled, which is typical for a secure system. However, the presence of the \"SFCDisable\" value could indicate an attempt to disable this security feature. These changes could be an attempt to evade detection and compromise the system's security. Further investigation into the purpose and functionality of \"sdra64.exe\" is recommended to determine the extent of the potential threat.",
