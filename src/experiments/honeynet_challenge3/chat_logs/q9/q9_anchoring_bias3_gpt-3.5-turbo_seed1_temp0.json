This value controls the number of cached logon credentials stored on the system. The presence of this value indicates that the system is configured to store up to 10 cached logon credentials. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to retrieve stored credentials and gain unauthorized access to the system or network resources. Further analysis of the system is recommended to determine if any malicious activities have been carried out using these cached logon credentials.",
