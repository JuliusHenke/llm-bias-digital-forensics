        "content": "The registry key \"Winlogon\" contains values that could be related to suppressing error reports or boot failure actions. Specifically, the value \"ReportBootOk\" is set to 1, which indicates that the system will report that the boot was successful. Additionally, the value \"ShutdownWithoutLogon\" is set to 0, suggesting that the system requires a user to log in before shutting down. These settings could potentially help malware remain undetected by masking system instability or errors. The presence of \"Userinit\" pointing to \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe,C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe,\" is also suspicious as it indicates additional processes being initiated during user login, which could be malicious. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its activities would be recommended to determine if it is related to the suspected malware.",
