        "content": "The registry key \"Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" contains values that could be related to the payload's activities. Specifically, the \"Userinit\" value includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe,\" which is not a standard system file. This could indicate the presence of malware attempting to persist on the system by executing alongside legitimate processes. Additionally, the \"Shell\" value pointing to \"Explorer.exe\" is normal, but malware often modifies this value to launch malicious code instead. The presence of unusual values like \"VmApplet\" and \"UIHost\" could also suggest attempts to manipulate system behavior for malicious purposes. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and monitoring for any suspicious behavior associated with these registry entries is recommended to determine the extent of the infection and its impact on the system.",
