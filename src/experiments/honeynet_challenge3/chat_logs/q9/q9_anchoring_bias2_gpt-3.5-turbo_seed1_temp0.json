This could potentially be a sign of malware activity trying to maintain persistence on the system by preventing a complete shutdown. The presence of \"userinit.exe\" and \"sdra64.exe\" in the \"Userinit\" value is suspicious as it suggests additional executables being run during user logon, which could be related to the unusual bank account activity. Further analysis of \"sdra64.exe\" and its activities on the system is recommended to determine its role in the incident.",
