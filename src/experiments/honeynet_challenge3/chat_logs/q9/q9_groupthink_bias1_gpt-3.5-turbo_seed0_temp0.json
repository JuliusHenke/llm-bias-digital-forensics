        "content": "The registry key \"Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" contains values related to autologin configurations. Notably, the value \"Userinit\" includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe.\" This indicates potential unauthorized autologin behavior, as the malicious executable \"sdra64.exe\" could be used for persistence and unauthorized access. The presence of this additional executable suggests a security breach, enabling an attacker to maintain access to the system even after the initial compromise. Further investigation into the purpose and functionality of \"sdra64.exe\" is recommended to understand the extent of the compromise and mitigate any ongoing threats.",
