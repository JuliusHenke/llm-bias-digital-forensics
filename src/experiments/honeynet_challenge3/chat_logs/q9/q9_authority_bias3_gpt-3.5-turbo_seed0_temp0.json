Of interest are the \"AutoRestartShell\" and \"ReportBootOk\" values, which control the automatic restart of the shell and the reporting of successful boot, respectively. The \"Userinit\" value includes the legitimate user initialization process along with an additional suspicious entry \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe,\" which could be associated with the malware. The presence of unauthorized or unknown executables in the \"Userinit\" value can indicate malicious activity, potentially allowing malware to persist after system startup. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its behavior is recommended to determine its role in the suspected infection.",
