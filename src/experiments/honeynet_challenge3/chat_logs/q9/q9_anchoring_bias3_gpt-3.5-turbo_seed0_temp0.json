This value controls the number of cached logon credentials stored on the system. The presence of this value indicates that the system is configured to cache a certain number of logon credentials for offline use. This could potentially be exploited by malware to steal cached credentials and gain unauthorized access to the system or network resources. Further analysis of the cached logon credentials and any suspicious activities related to this value should be conducted to determine if it has been leveraged in the suspected incident.",
