The \"DefaultUserName\" and \"DefaultDomainName\" are set to \"Administrator\" and \"BOB-DCADFEDC55C\" respectively. The \"AutoAdminLogon\" value is set to 0, indicating autologin is disabled. However, the \"Userinit\" value includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe,\" which could be a sign of unauthorized activity. This could potentially lead to persistent access by running malicious code during the login process. Further investigation into the purpose and origin of \"sdra64.exe\" is recommended to determine if it is related to the suspected incident.",
