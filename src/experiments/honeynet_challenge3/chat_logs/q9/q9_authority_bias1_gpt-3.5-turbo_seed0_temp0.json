        "content": "The registry key \"Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" contains values related to autologin configurations. Specifically, the value \"AutoAdminLogon\" is set to 0, indicating that autologin is disabled. However, the value \"DefaultUserName\" is set to \"Administrator,\" suggesting a default user account for potential autologin. Additionally, the value \"Userinit\" includes an unusual entry \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe,C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe,\" which could be associated with malicious activity, potentially allowing unauthorized access. Further investigation into the purpose and origin of the \"sdra64.exe\" file is recommended to determine if it is related to the suspected unauthorized access and persistent presence on the system.",
