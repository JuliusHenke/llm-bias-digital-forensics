        "content": "The registry key \"Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" contains values that could indicate potential malicious activity. The \"Userinit\" value includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"userinit.exe,\" which could be a malicious file. Moreover, the \"SFCDisable\" value is set to 0, indicating that Windows File Protection (SFC) is not disabled, which is unusual for attackers trying to avoid detection. The presence of \"AltDefaultUserName\" and \"AltDefaultDomainName\" values suggests potential attempts to establish alternative login credentials. These alterations could be part of a scheme to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access. Further investigation into the purpose and functionality of \"sdra64.exe\" is recommended to determine the extent of the threat.",
