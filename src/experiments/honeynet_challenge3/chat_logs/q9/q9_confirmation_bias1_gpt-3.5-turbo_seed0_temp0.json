The values \"DefaultUserName\" and \"DefaultDomainName\" are set to \"Administrator\" and \"BOB-DCADFEDC55C\" respectively, indicating potential autologin settings. The value \"AutoAdminLogon\" is set to 0, suggesting autologin is disabled. However, the \"Userinit\" value includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe,\" which could be suspicious and worth investigating further. This additional executable could be related to the unauthorized access and unusual bank account activity. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its activities is recommended to determine its role in the incident.",
