In this case, the \"Userinit\" value includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe\". This indicates potential malicious activity as an unauthorized executable is being launched during user logon. The presence of \"sdra64.exe\" could be a sign of a malware infection attempting to maintain persistence on the system. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its behavior is recommended to determine the extent of the threat and its impact on the system.",
