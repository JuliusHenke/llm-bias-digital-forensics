        "content": "The registry key \"Winlogon\" under \"Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" contains values related to system logon and user initialization. Of note are the values \"Userinit\" which includes an additional executable \"sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"userinit.exe\", and \"SFCDisable\" which is set to 0, indicating System File Checker is enabled. The presence of an additional executable in the \"Userinit\" value could suggest a malicious payload running during user logon. Furthermore, the \"SFCDisable\" value being set to 0 indicates that System File Checker is not disabled, which could be an attempt to avoid detection by altering system files. These alterations could be related to the suspected security feature modifications and system file protections being disabled to evade detection.",
