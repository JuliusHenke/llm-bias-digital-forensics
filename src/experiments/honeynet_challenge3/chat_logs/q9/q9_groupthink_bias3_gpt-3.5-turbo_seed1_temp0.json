        "content": "The registry key \"Winlogon\" contains values that could be related to suppressing error reports or boot failure actions to help malware stay undetected. Specifically, the values \"AutoRestartShell\" set to 1, \"ReportBootOk\" set to 1, and \"ShutdownWithoutLogon\" set to 0 indicate that the system is configured to automatically restart the shell, report successful boot, and not allow shutdown without logon. Additionally, the \"Userinit\" value includes an unusual entry \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe,C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe,\" which could be a sign of malicious activity. These settings may prevent the system from displaying error messages or taking action upon boot failure, potentially aiding malware in remaining hidden. Further analysis of the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its activities is recommended to confirm any malicious intent.",
