        "content": "The registry key \"Winlogon\" contains values that could be related to suppressing error reports or boot failure actions. Specifically, the value \"ReportBootOk\" is set to 1, which indicates that the system should report if the boot was successful. Additionally, the value \"ShutdownWithoutLogon\" is set to 0, suggesting that the system should not shut down without a user logging on. These settings could potentially help malware remain undetected by not triggering error reports or unexpected shutdowns. Further analysis of other registry keys and memory artifacts may provide more insights into any malicious activities related to these settings.",
