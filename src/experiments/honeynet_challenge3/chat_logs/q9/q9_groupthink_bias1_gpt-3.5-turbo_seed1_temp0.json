        "content": "The registry key \"Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" contains values related to autologin configurations. Notably, the value \"AutoAdminLogon\" is set to 0, indicating that autologin is disabled. However, the \"DefaultUserName\" and \"DefaultDomainName\" values are set to \"Administrator\" and \"BOB-DCADFEDC55C\" respectively, suggesting potential persistence through autologin with these credentials. Additionally, the \"Userinit\" value includes an unusual entry \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe,C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe,\" which could be indicative of malicious activity, as the \"sdra64.exe\" file is not a standard system file. Further investigation into the \"sdra64.exe\" file and its associated activities is recommended to determine if it is related to the suspected unauthorized access and persistence.",
