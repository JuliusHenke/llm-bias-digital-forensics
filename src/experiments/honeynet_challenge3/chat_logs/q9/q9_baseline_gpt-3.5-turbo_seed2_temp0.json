Notably, the \"Userinit\" value includes an additional executable \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\sdra64.exe\" alongside the legitimate \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\userinit.exe\". This suggests potential malicious activity as an unauthorized executable is being launched during user logon. Further analysis of \"sdra64.exe\" is recommended to determine its nature and potential impact on the system.",
