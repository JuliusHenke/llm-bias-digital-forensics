The investigator should focus on analyzing the memory image for any suspicious activities related to the svchost.exe process, as it is a common process used by malware to disguise its presence. Additionally, looking for any unusual network connections or file modifications associated with svchost.exe could provide further evidence of malicious activity. It is crucial to investigate any anomalies related to this process to determine if it is indeed a keylogger or another type of malware masquerading as a legitimate system process.",
