This is indicated by the presence of the firefox.exe process in the memory image and the suspicious activity in the victim's bank account post opening the PDF file. The banking trojan could have been designed to capture sensitive banking information entered by the victim while using their browser, leading to the unauthorized access to their bank account. Further analysis of the firefox.exe process and its associated memory regions would be necessary to confirm the presence and functionality of the banking trojan.",
