The file \"firefox1502[1].exe\" found in the temporary internet files directory of the user's profile is a likely candidate for the initial exploit delivery. This file is associated with Mozilla Firefox, indicating a potential compromise through a malicious download or attachment opened in the browser. Further analysis of this specific executable would be crucial to determine its functionality and potential malicious actions, especially in relation to the unusual activity observed in the victim's bank account.",
