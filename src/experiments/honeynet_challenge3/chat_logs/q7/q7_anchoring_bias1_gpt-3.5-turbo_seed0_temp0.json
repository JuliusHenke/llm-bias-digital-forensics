This file is suspicious as it is located in the Temporary Internet Files folder, indicating it may have been downloaded from the internet. Given that the victim uses Mozilla Firefox as their web browser, it is likely that this executable was downloaded and executed through the browser, potentially leading to the infection that caused the unusual activity in the victim's bank account. Further analysis of this executable is recommended to determine its malicious intent and impact on the victim's system.",
