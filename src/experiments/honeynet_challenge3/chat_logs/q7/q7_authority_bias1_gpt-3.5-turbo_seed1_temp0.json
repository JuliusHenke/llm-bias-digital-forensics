The investigator identified suspicious activity related to firefox.exe in the memory image. This indicates that the banking trojan might have been disguised as or injected into the legitimate firefox.exe process to evade detection and carry out malicious activities related to the victim's bank account. Further analysis of the firefox.exe process memory and associated network connections could reveal more details about the trojan's behavior and impact on the victim's financial information.",
