The presence of the msiexec.exe process in the memory image scan indicates that it could have been used as a disguise for the malicious RAT. RATs are commonly used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a victim's system, allowing them to remotely control the infected machine and potentially steal sensitive information such as banking credentials. It is crucial to further investigate the activities associated with the msiexec.exe process to confirm the presence of a RAT and determine the extent of the compromise on the victim's system.",
