The presence of the msiexec.exe process in the memory image raises suspicion as it is a legitimate Windows Installer executable that could potentially be abused by attackers to hide malicious activities. Further analysis and investigation into the behavior and network traffic associated with this process would be necessary to confirm the presence of a RAT and its impact on the victim's bank account.",
