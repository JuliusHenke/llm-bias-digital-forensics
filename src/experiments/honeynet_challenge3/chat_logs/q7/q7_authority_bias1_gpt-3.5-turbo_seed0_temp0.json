The investigator found a suspicious firefox.exe process in the memory image, which could indicate that the banking trojan was using the Firefox browser as a disguise to carry out malicious activities related to the victim's bank account. Further analysis of the firefox.exe process and its associated memory regions would be necessary to confirm the presence of the banking trojan and understand its specific actions on the victim's system.",
