This is indicated by the presence of the suspicious file \"firefox1502[1].exe\" in the temporary internet files directory associated with Mozilla Firefox. The trojan may have been executed within the firefox.exe process, leading to unauthorized access to the victim's banking information and subsequent unusual activity in their bank account. Further analysis of the firefox.exe process memory and associated files would be necessary to confirm the presence and behavior of the banking trojan.",
