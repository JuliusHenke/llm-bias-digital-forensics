The file \"firefox1502[1].exe\" found in the temporary internet files directory of the user's profile is a likely candidate for the initial exploit delivery. This file is associated with Mozilla Firefox, indicating a potential compromise through a malicious download or attachment opened in the browser. Further analysis of this file and its activities within the memory image is recommended to confirm its role in the suspected banking account compromise.",
