The investigator's suspicion is supported by the presence of a suspicious executable named \"sdra64.exe\" in the system32 directory, which could be the keylogger masquerading as a legitimate system process. Keyloggers are designed to capture keystrokes, potentially including sensitive information like banking credentials, leading to unauthorized access to the victim's bank account. Further analysis and investigation into the behavior and activities of \"sdra64.exe\" would be crucial to confirm its malicious intent and impact on the victim's financial security.",
