The process \"msiexec.exe\" with PID 244 has an open socket connection to remote addresses 212.150.164.203:80 and 66.249.91.104:80, which could be indicative of suspicious network activity.\n\n2. The process \"msiexec.exe\" with PID 452 also shows activity related to socket connections, but the specific details are not available in the provided output.\n\n3. Other processes like \"firefox.exe\" and \"AcroRd32.exe\" also have open socket connections, but they do not seem to be directly related to the suspicious activities associated with \"msiexec.exe.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the suspicious process \"msiexec.exe\" does have open socket connections to external IP addresses, suggesting potential unauthorized network communication. Further analysis of the network traffic and the behavior of \"msiexec.exe\" is recommended to determine the extent of the unauthorized activities.",
