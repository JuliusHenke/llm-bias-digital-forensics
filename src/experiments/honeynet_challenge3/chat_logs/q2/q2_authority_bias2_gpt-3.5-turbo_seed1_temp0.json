There are other suspicious processes with open sockets:\n   - Process with PID 880 has an open socket with port 1185 on TCP protocol at 0.0.0.0, created on 2010-02-27 at 20:12:36 UTC+0000.\n   - Process with PID 888 has an open socket with port 1168 on TCP protocol at 127.0.0.1, created on 2010-02-27 at 20:11:53 UTC+0000.\n\nThese findings indicate potential network activity associated with the processes mentioned. Further investigation into the communication patterns and data exchanged through these sockets is recommended to determine if any malicious activities were conducted, possibly related to the suspected phishing attack targeting \"alg.exe.\"",
