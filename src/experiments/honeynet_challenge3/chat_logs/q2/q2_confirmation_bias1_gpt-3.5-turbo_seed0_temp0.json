AcroRd32.exe (PID 1752) has an open socket connection to 212.150.164.203:80.\n3. svchost.exe (PID 880) has open socket connections to 193.104.22.71:80 and 193.104.22.71:80.\n\nAdditionally, there are UDP connections established by various processes, including msiexec.exe and svchost.exe, to local and external IP addresses.\n\nThe presence of msiexec.exe with network activity could indicate potential unauthorized activities, especially if the connections are to suspicious external IP addresses. Further analysis of the network traffic and the behavior of these processes is recommended to determine the extent of the suspicious activities and their impact on the employee's bank account.",
