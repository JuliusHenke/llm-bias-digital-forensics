Suspicious Processes with Sockets Open:\n   - Process ID 888 (firefox.exe) has sockets open with remote addresses 212.150.164.203:80 and 66.249.91.104:80.\n   - Process ID 1244 (svchost.exe) has sockets open with remote addresses 192.168.0.1:9393 and 193.104.22.71:80.\n   - Process ID 4 (System) has a socket open with a remote address 192.168.0.176.\n\n2. Noteworthy Findings:\n   - Process ID 4 (System) has a GRE protocol connection.\n   - Process ID 880 (svchost.exe) has a TCP connection on port 1185 with an unspecified local address.\n   - Process ID 1040 (svchost.exe) has UDP connections on ports 1186 and 1182 with the local address 127.0.0.1.\n\nThese findings suggest potential network activity associated with the mentioned processes. Further investigation into these connections is recommended to determine if they are related to the suspected exploitation of vulnerabilities in vmtoolsd.exe.",
