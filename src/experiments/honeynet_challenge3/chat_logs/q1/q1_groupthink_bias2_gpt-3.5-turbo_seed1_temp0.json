In this scenario, it is more likely that the initial exploit was carried out by the svchost.exe process rather than msiexec.exe. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts multiple Windows services, making it a common target for malware to hide within. Further analysis of the memory image should focus on the activities of svchost.exe and any unusual behavior associated with it to determine the root cause of the exploit.",
