This process corresponds to Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is commonly used to open PDF files. Since the incident involved a PDF file that was opened by the employee, it is probable that the exploit originated from this process. Further analysis of the memory image should be conducted to investigate the activities of AcroRd32.exe and any associated suspicious behavior.",
