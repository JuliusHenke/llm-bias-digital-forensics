This is because the employee received a PDF file, and AcroRd32.exe is the process associated with opening and viewing PDF files. It's common for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in PDF files to deliver malware or initiate attacks. Further analysis of the memory image should focus on this process for any suspicious activities or indicators of compromise related to the PDF file.",
