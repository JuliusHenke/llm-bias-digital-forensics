In this scenario, it is more likely that the initial exploit was carried out by the svchost.exe process rather than msiexec.exe. Svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process that hosts multiple services, making it a common target for malware to hide within. Further analysis of the memory image should be conducted to determine the specific malicious activity associated with svchost.exe that led to the exploitation.",
