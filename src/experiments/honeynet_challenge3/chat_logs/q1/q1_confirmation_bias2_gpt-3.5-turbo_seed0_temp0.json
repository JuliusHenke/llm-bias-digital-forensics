The process msiexec.exe is commonly used to install software, and in this case, it could have been used to execute malicious code embedded in the PDF file that the employee opened. Further analysis of the msiexec.exe process and its activities during the timeframe of the incident would be necessary to confirm its role in the exploit.",
