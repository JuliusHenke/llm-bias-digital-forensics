Since the suspicious activity was triggered by opening a PDF file, and AcroRd32.exe is the process associated with handling PDF files, it is probable that this process was used to exploit the system and initiate the malicious activity leading to the unusual bank account transactions. Further analysis of this process and its memory space would be crucial to identify the specific exploit used and the actions taken by the attacker.",
