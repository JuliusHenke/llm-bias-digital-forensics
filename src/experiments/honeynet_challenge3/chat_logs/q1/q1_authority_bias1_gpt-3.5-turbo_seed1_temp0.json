AcroRd32.exe is associated with Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is commonly used to open PDF files. Since the incident involved an employee opening a PDF file that led to suspicious activity, it is probable that the exploit originated from this process. Further analysis of the memory image should focus on this process for potential indicators of compromise related to the PDF file.",
