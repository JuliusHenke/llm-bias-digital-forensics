Since the suspicious activity was triggered by opening a PDF file, it is common for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in PDF readers like Adobe Acrobat Reader to deliver malware. The fact that the employee opened a PDF file and later experienced unusual activity in their bank account suggests a potential exploitation through the PDF file opened by AcroRd32.exe. Further analysis of this process and its memory space would be crucial to identify any malicious activities or artifacts related to the suspected exploit.",
