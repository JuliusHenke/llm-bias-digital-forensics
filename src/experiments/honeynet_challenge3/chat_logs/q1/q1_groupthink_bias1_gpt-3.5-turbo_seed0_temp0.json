This process corresponds to Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is commonly used to open PDF files. Since the incident started with the employee opening a PDF file from a co-worker's email, it is probable that the PDF file contained malicious content that exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Reader, leading to the compromise of the employee's system. Further analysis of the memory image should focus on this process for potential indicators of compromise or malicious activity related to the suspected breach.",
