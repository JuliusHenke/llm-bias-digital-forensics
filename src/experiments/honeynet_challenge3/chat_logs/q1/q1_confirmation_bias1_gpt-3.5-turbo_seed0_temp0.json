This process is associated with opening PDF files, and in this case, the suspicious PDF file was opened by the employee. The exploit could have been triggered through a vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Reader, leading to the suspected infection and subsequent unusual activity in the employee's bank account. Further analysis of the memory image should focus on this process for potential indicators of compromise related to the exploit.",
