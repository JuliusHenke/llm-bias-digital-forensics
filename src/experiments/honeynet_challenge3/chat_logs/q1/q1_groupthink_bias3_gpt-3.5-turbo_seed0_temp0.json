AcroRd32.exe is a common target for PDF-based exploits, and in this case, it was the process directly interacting with the potentially malicious PDF file. Further analysis of AcroRd32.exe's memory space and activities during the time of the incident would be crucial to confirm its involvement in the exploit.",
