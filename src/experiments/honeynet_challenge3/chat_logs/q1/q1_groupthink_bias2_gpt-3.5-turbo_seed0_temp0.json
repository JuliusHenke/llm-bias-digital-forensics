        "content": "Based on the process list provided, the msiexec.exe process (PID 244) was likely responsible for the initial exploit. This process is often used to install software on Windows systems and can be abused by attackers to execute malicious code. The fact that msiexec.exe is not a common process to be run by a user and its presence in the list of processes suggests that it might have been used as a vector for the initial exploit. Further analysis of the memory image should be conducted to determine the specific actions taken by msiexec.exe and any associated artifacts that could confirm its role in the breach.",
