The process msiexec.exe (PID 244) then spawned another instance of msiexec.exe (PID 452) shortly after. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate that the initial exploit was triggered by the msiexec.exe process (PID 244), which then led to the creation of a new instance (PID 452) for further malicious activities. Further analysis of the memory image is recommended to uncover the full extent of the exploit and any associated activities.",
