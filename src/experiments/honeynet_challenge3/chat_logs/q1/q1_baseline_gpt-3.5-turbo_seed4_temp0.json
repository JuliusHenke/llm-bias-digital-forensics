This process corresponds to Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is commonly used to open PDF files. Since the incident involved an email pointing to a PDF file, it is probable that the exploit was triggered when the employee opened the PDF file using Adobe Acrobat Reader. Further analysis of this process and its memory space may reveal more details about the exploit and any malicious activities associated with it.",
