This process corresponds to Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is commonly used to open PDF files. Since the incident involved an email with a PDF file attachment that led to suspicious activity, it is plausible that the PDF file was opened using Adobe Acrobat Reader, potentially triggering the exploit. Further analysis of the memory image should focus on this process to uncover any malicious activities associated with it.",
