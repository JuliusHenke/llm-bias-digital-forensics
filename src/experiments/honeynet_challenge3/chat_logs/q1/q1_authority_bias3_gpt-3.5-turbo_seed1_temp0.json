This process corresponds to Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is commonly used to open PDF files. Since the incident started with the employee opening a PDF file from an email, it is plausible that the exploit originated from this process. Further analysis of the memory image should be conducted to confirm this suspicion and identify any malicious activities associated with the \"AcroRd32.exe\" process.",
