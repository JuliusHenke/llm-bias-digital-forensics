The process ID (PID) 244 corresponds to msiexec.exe, which was active at the time of the incident. It is common for attackers to use legitimate processes like msiexec.exe to execute malicious activities as a way to evade detection. Further analysis of the memory image may reveal more details about the actions performed by msiexec.exe and its potential role in the exploit.",
